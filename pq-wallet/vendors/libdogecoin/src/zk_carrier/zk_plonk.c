 * PLONK proof system.
 *
 * Not implemented in this revision.  When implemented, the recommended
 * path is libsnark's PLONK gadget or a thin C wrapper around an external
 * PLONK verifier (e.g., halo2-style).  The mode byte (DOGECOIN_ZK_MODE_PLONK
 * = 1) is reserved here so on-chain artifacts can be produced today and
 * verified once the verifier ships, mirroring the reserved-opcode mode
 * selector proposal.
